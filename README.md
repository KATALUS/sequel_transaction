Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'sequel_transaction'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sequel_transaction

## Sidekiq Wireup

To automatically wrap Sidekiq work processes in a transaction, add the following:

```ruby
Sidekiq.configure_server do |c|
  c.server_middleware do |chain|
    chain.add Sidekiq::Middleware::Server::Transaction,
      connection: Sequel.connect('sqlite:///')
  end
end
```

It may be useful to ensure the transaction has been committed before queuing up
work by adding the following:

```ruby
Sidekiq.configure_client do |c|
  c.client_middleware do |chain|
    chain.add Sidekiq::Middleware::Client::AfterCommit,
      connection: Sequel.connect('sqlite:///')
  end
end
```

## Rack Wireup

To automatically wrap requests in a transaction, add the following:

```ruby
use Rack::Transaction,
  connection: Sequel.connect('sqlite:///')
```
